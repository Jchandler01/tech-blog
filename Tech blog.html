	<p>The video "Humans need not apply" talks about how humans in the near future will loose their jobs due to the rapid increase of new technology. Dozens of jobs, including transportation, constrution labor, and even medical jobs, will inevitably be taken over by robots. Even the jobs that involve creativity and human emotion will be taken over, because robots are constantly growing and learning. Many people believe that this technology is very far away, however this technology actually exists now. While jobs won't be completely taken over right now it will eventully happen.</p>
	<p>This is a huge problem that the human race is not prepared for. The people in power need to face the inevitable truth that robots will be leaving millions of people unemployed and we need to come up with a solution fast. </p>

	<p>The passage "Knowing where you are" talked about how gps’s work and that they can track a person from any point on earth. Gps's can help people get to places, help track someone if they are lost, and help find your friends.</p>
	<p>In the passage "Black Boxes Are Not Just for Airplanes Anymore" it talked about how EDRs can show how fast a person was driving at all times in order to prove if someone is innocent or guilty. </p>
	<p>In the passage "The Parking Garage Knows More Than You Think" License plates are actually photographed at garages when you receive the ticket in order to make sure no one steals someone’s car</p>
	<p>As technology has changed over time it has helped keep people safe and uphold laws.</p>

	<center><h2>Interview</h2>
	<h3>By: Jack Chandler</h3></center>
	<p>I interviewed my Mother on her opinons on technology including what it was like when she was my age and how she feels technology is changing</p>
	<p>Me: How old were you when you got your first computer?</p>
	<p class="Janet_lines">Janet: 36</p>
	<p>Me: What was your favorite piece of technology when you were growing up?</p>
	<p class="Janet_lines">Janet: TV</p>
	<p>Me: How has technology changed over your lifetime?</p>
	<p class="Janet_lines">Janet: It has changed a lot! Biggest change is mobile phones. Quick access to information, emails in the palm of your hand. When I was growing up I would write a letter to a friend that was far away and wait a week or so for a reply. Now I can text and geta reply in a instant.</p>
	<p>Me: Have the changes you've seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or society?</p>
	<p class="Janet_lines">Janet: Both! It is definetly really good to stay in contact with family and friends. Also really conveniant to have quick access to information. But it has been bad because now we are all of obsessed with our phones. Maybe even addicted to them.</p>

	<p class="Janet_lines">Janet: Connecting to yourself and to other peolpe is more important then connecting to technoolgy.</p>
	<p>Me: Do you think technology will continue to change?</p>
	<p class="Janet_lines">Janet: Yes! I can't imagine what technology is going to look like when you are my age. It's a little scary!</p>
